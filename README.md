- OWASP ZAP - Web application testing

**Penetration Testing:**
- Burp Suite - Web proxy & scanner
- Metasploit Framework - Exploitation framework
- Hashcat - Password cracking

**Network Analysis:**
- Wireshark - Packet analysis
- tcpdump - Network packet capture
- Snort - Intrusion detection

**Incident Response:**

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Risk)
- **SQL Injection** - Database query manipulation (3 instances)
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** - Unauthenticated file upload (2 instances)
- **Authentication Bypass** - Weak session management (4 instances)

### High-Severity Issues
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Stored & reflected (8 instances)
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** - User data exposure (5 instances)
- **Privilege Escalation** - Kernel exploits & sudo misconfigurations (6 instances)

### Medium-Severity Issues
- Weak SSL/TLS configurations
- Unencrypted sensitive data transmission
- Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)

## Remediation Strategies

### NIST Framework Alignment

**IDENTIFY** ↳ Asset inventory & risk assessment  
**PROTECT** ↳ Access controls & encryption deployment  
**DETECT** ↳ Logging & monitoring implementation  
**RESPOND** ↳ Incident response playbook activation  
**RECOVER** ↳ System restoration & lessons learned  

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate (Week 1):** Critical vulnerabilities remediation
2. **Short-term (Week 2-4):** High-severity fixes + security patches
3. **Medium-term (Month 2-3):** Infrastructure hardening
4. **Long-term (Ongoing):** Security monitoring & continuous improvement
